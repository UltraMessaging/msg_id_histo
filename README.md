# Introduction

This repository holds several tools that the UM support team have
found useful in analyzing UM Store and DRO log files.
These tools are informal and un-polished,
and are offered in the spirit of engineers helping
fellow engineers.
I.e. don't expect the same level of maturity, functionality,
or even quality as the UM product itself. :-)

## Tool Set

* msg_id_histo.pl - Count number of instances of each message type in a Store or DRO log file.
* dro_filter_log.sh - Filter out "normal" logs from a DRO log file.
* epoch_log_times.pl - Prepend epoch time to each Store or DRO log file line.
* reroute_runs.pl - find "runs" of reroute logs in a Store log file.

# msg_id_histo.pl

This simple tool (written in perl) scans a UM Store or DRO log file
and counts the number of ocurrences of the different types of logs,
keyed by the message ID (e.g. "Core-0001-1:").

It will also print the text of the message - the first instance it finds.
For example, if a DRO log file contains a series of Core-6259-2: route
discovery messages with different IP addresses,
they will all be counted towards the Core-6259-2: total,
and the displayed text will be from the first instance found.

The tool is simple,
but I have used it enough times that I think it deserves its own repo.
If you know your way around perl regular expression matching,
it can be pretty easily modified to scan application log files.

# msg_id_histo.py

Python port of Perl tool, for those who prefer Python.

## Quick Start

Download the msg_id_histo repository and copy "msg_id_histo.pl" into your PATH.
It is a good idea for you to examine the code to ensure there isn't anything
dangerous in it (it's short and simple enough that it shouldn't take too long).

### Store

````

Notice the line "[2023-06-22 18:07:22.941700] [emergency] FATAL: failed assertion..."
The tool is not able to find a message ID in that line, so it prints it before
printing message counts.

### Repeat Count

If you examine the "test_dro.log" you will find that it does NOT contain 26
instances of Core-5688-3373.
However, note that it is "throttled" log, meaning that UM suppresses logs that
come out in rapid succession.

In the DRO example log:
````
[2022-10-22 12:18:56.713898] [warning] THROTTLED MSG: Core-5688-3373: No active resolver instances, sending via inactive instance
[2022-10-22 12:18:56.813898] [information] Gwd-6033-618: peer portal [PEER1] failed to connect to peer at [10.55.35.120:10190] via [10.237.176.219]
[2022-10-22 12:18:56.913898] [information] Gwd-6033-618: peer portal [PEER2] failed to connect to peer at [10.55.35.118:10190] via [10.237.176.219]
[2022-10-22 12:18:56.993898] [warning] ...previous THROTTLED MSG repeated 25 times in 1 seconds
````
The tool counts the first instance of Core-5688-3373,
and then adds 25 to it when it sees the "repeated 25 times" log.
(It has to remember what the previous *throttled* message was.)

You can prevent the tool from adding in the "repeated X time" by passing the "-t" option:
````
$ msg_id_histo.pl -t test_dro.log
[2023-06-22 18:07:22.941700] [emergency] FATAL: failed assertion [portal->peer.rcv_msg_state!=NULL] at line 3004 in ../../../../src/gateway/tnwgpeer.c

### Sort the Output

The output is sorted by the message ID.
I often find it useful to re-sort it by the count:
````
$ msg_id_histo.pl test_dro.log | sort -n
[2023-06-22 18:07:22.941700] [emergency] FATAL: failed assertion [portal->peer.rcv_msg_state!=NULL] at line 3004 in ../../../../src/gateway/tnwgpeer.c

26 - Core-5688-3373: No active resolver instances, sending via inactive instance
````
Note the "-n".
The most-often logged messages are at the bottom.

### DRO Gwd-6033-618:

The DRO message ID "Gwd-6033-618:" deviates from the normal UM model of
having the message ID represent a given message type.
Instead, "Gwd-6033-618:" represents a wide range of messages.
So it is treated differently in the tool, including the constant
parts of the messages as part of the message ID.
Therefore, you can get multiple message counts for differnt "Gwd-6033-618:"
messages.
The variable parts of the message texts are replaced with "x".

For example:
````
$ msg_id_histo.pl 618.log
140 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x connected to x
925 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x detected dropped inbound connection x
307 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x failed to connect to peer at x via x
30 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x failed to create peer accept socket x: CoreApi-5688-3231: TCP server bind x: x Address already in use
925 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x inbound connection destroyed due to disconnect
119 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x inbound connection destroyed due to shutdown
121 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x lost connection to peer at x via x
119 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x outbound connection destroyed due to shutdown
110 - Gwd-6033-618: peer portal x received connection from x
````

# dro_filter_log.sh

The "dro_filter_log.sh" script contains a simple 'sed' stript that removes "normal"
logs from a DRO log file.
I.e. if "dro_filter_log.sh" scans a DRO log file and generates no output,
you can feel pretty confident that the DRO ran without incident.
Any output lines deserve to be investigated.

It is not unusual to use 'dro_filter_log.sh' in conjunction with 'msg_id_histo.pl':
````
$ dro_filter_log.sh dro.log >dro_errs.log
$ wc dro_errs.log
  59917  974777 9408112 dro_errs.log
````
Almost 60k lines of errors. Hard to digest. Let's get a historgram
````
$ msg_id_histo.pl dro_errs.log >dro_histo.log
$ wc dro_histo.log
  33  445 3318 dro_histo.log
````
33 lines of histogram. Much easier to examine.
````

# epoch_log_times.pl

There are times that it is helpful to combine log files from
multiple instances of a daemon,
or even from different daemons.
For example,
we recently had a case where the logs of both Stores and
DROs had useful information and we wanted to put together
a detailed timeline.

But Store and DRO logs use different time stamp formats,
which makes it a difficult and manual process to combine
two files.

The epoch_log_times.pl reads one or more files and simply
prepends a "@" followed by the [epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)
(sometimes called "Unix time").
This represents the number of seconds after the system's "epoch".
I.e. the epoch time is a simple integer.

For example:

@1687457242 [2023-06-22 18:07:22.941700] [emergency] FATAL: failed assertion [portal->peer.rcv_msg_state!=NULL] at line 3004 in ../../../../src/gateway/tnwgpeer.c
````
The test logs don't do the best job of demonstrating the feature,
but notice that the DRO fatal assert in 2023 is ordered after the Store logs in 2022.
Also note that for Store logs that have the same timestamp,
the original order is retained.
This is accomplished by the "-s" sort option.

# reroute_runs.pl

This is a special-purpose tool for a customer issue where the UM version 6.5
DRO (which had several bugs, since fixed) sometimes led to network instability.
One symtom of this instability is re-route messages appearing repeatedly
in the Store logs.

But the occasional re-route log is not an indication of instability.
So we wanted a tool that looked for "runs" of re-route messages and
kept track of the start and end times of a run, and the number of
re-routes in the run.

A "run" is defined by a set of re-route events that are separated by
less than "-t threshold" seconds (defaults to 60).
Thus, a large number of frequent re-routes spanning an extended time
will be reported as a single run, with the number of events and the
time span reported.

Note that a re-route "event" is not simply a single instance of
a re-route log message.
This is because the Store has two contexts,
each of which will report a given re-route.
Also, a re-route event can affect multiple TRDs.
So a single re-route "event" can consist of
many log lines.

An imperfect but simple way to count the re-route events is to
assume that re-routes that happen in the same second are all part
of the same event.
So the following logs are counted as three events in a single run:

The tool also is intended to suppress runs that are short-lived.
For a run to be reported, it must last at least
"-d duration_min_report" seconds (defaults to 10) and
contain at least "-n num_min_report" re-route events (defaults to 10).
The above example will not be reported because even though it lasted 26 seconds,
it only contains 3 re-route events.

But you can tell the tool to report all runs, regarless of size, as follows:
